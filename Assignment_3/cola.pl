/* 9. There is an old song that goes as follows:
        99 bottles of coke on the wall
        99 bottles of coke
        You take one down and pass it around
        98 bottles of coke on the wall
    And so on, until the last verse:
        1 bottle of coke on the wall
        1 bottle of coke
        You take one down and pass it around
        No bottle of coke on the wall
    Write a Prolog program cola that receives a positive integer and prints the Lyrics of the song.
    The program should print all the verses, and when it gets to the last verse, it must print 1 bottle.
    Not 1 bottles, and no bottle rather than 0 bottles.
